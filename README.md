# School Timetable Generator

This project is a web application built using Streamlit that generates school timetables based on user input. It allows users to specify the number of subjects, periods per subject, number of sections, and periods per day. The application then generates a timetable for each section, ensuring that all subjects are allocated the specified number of periods and that free periods are distributed randomly.

## Features

- Displays timetables in a tabular format
- Allows users to download timetables as CSV files
